                    <p>
                    The first digit of any credit card number is referred to as the Major Industry Identifier (MII). Additionally, the initial six or eight digits of a credit card number, including the first MII digit, are collectively known as the Issuer Identification Number (IIN).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Bank Identification Numbers (BINs) are more commonly referred to as Issuer Identification Numbers (IINs). This nomenclature stems from the fact that cards can be issued by institutions beyond traditional banks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The Issuer Identification Number (IIN) serves the crucial purpose of identifying the card issuing institution responsible for issuing the card to the cardholder. The card issuer reserves the remaining digits of the card number, with the card's length determined by the total number of digits. Many card issuers opt to include both the complete IIN and the account number on their cards.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    For a comprehensive understanding of the Major Industry Identifier (MII) and Issuer Identification Number (IIN), please refer to the table below for quick identification of credit cards within the Major Industry.

                        A Credit Card Generator is a tool designed to produce valid credit card numbers exclusively for the purposes of testing and development within the programming, educational, and software development domains.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's essential to emphasize that these credit card numbers are entirely fictitious and incapable of facilitating genuine transactions. Instead, they are employed for the assessment of payment processing systems and for developmental objectives.

                        Please bear in mind: CreditCardGen's Credit Card Generator does not generate credit card numbers with actual monetary value and does not pertain to any legitimate cardholder. The cardholder's name, address, funds, CVV/CVC, expiration date, and PIN are all randomly generated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you require a bona fide credit card number for authentic transactions, we strongly recommend obtaining one through a reputable financial institution such as a bank or credit card company. CreditCardGen is NOT a financial institution and does not issue authentic credit card numbers.

                        Before you proceed with your credit card application, it is advisable to thoroughly explore the available credit card offers, encompassing options such as balance transfers, cashback rewards, and loyalty programs.

                    A Credit Card Generator functions by producing random virtual credit card numbers based on the Bank Identification Number (BIN) through the utilization of the Luhn Algorithm. The Luhn Algorithm is also recognized as the Modulus 10 or Mod-10 algorithm.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    We consistently adhere to the principles of the Luhn Algorithm when generating credit card particulars. The credit card generator tool emulates the procedures employed by credit card issuers in crafting their cards.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    To utilize the Credit Card Generator, simply designate the BIN or input the BIN into the BIN Generator for which you intend to create a number, and then click the "GENERATE" button. The tool will yield legitimate credit card numbers that are suitable for testing or developmental purposes.
